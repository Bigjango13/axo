## State

The project is at an early stage of development, so most things can and most likely will change!
The compiler leaks, and it leaks a ton, so use it at your own risk!

## Goal and target
This language is mainly built for my personal use, but maybe some people will find it usable and fun, so it's public. Think of it as a more modern C language without all the nasty modern stuff like in C++. (and no OOP! yes, it's a feature nowadays 🤠)
